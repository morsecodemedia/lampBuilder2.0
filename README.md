# lampBuilder 2.0

Based on [sarcastrons's lampBuilder](https://www.github.com/sarcastron/lampBuilder), this is a small BASH script for setting up a LAMP server with webmin on Ubuntu.

The script will update Ubunutu, add a webmin as a source, and install the following packages: apache2 php5 php5-cgi php-pear php5-gd php5-curl php5-fpm libapache2-mod-fastcgi mysql-server mysql-client postfix proftpd alpine git mercurial unzip webmin php5-mysql - **updated**

After the package manager is done, it will assist with user creation.
